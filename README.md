# Digital-Signal-Processing-DSP--MATLAB-Experiments
A curated collection of five core Digital Signal Processing labs covering discrete-time signals, LTI systems, poles and zeros, DFT/IDFT, and FIR filter design. Each lab includes MATLAB code, output plots, and clear explanationsâ€”designed for fast learning, exam prep, and reproducible research.
# ðŸ“Š DSP Lab Series â€“ MATLAB Code & Explanations

This repository contains MATLAB code and detailed explanations for five core DSP lab experiments completed during my undergraduate coursework at Pokhara University.

## ðŸ”¬ Lab Topics

1. **Discrete-Time Signals** â€“ Signal generation, plotting, and basic operations  
2. **Discrete LTI Systems** â€“ Convolution, impulse response, and system behavior  
3. **Poles and Zeros** â€“ Transfer function analysis and stability visualization  
4. **DFT and IDFT** â€“ Frequency domain analysis using FFT and IFFT  
5. **Digital FIR Filter Design** â€“ Low-pass FIR filter using windowing techniques

Each lab folder includes:
- MATLAB source code (`.m` files)
- Output plots (`.png`)
- Detailed explanation (`.txt`) of the code logic and results
